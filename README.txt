    WARNING: Always back up your worlds before deployment.
================================================================

This mod is intended to expose items on the RefinedStorage network to external storage management systems
such as Integrated Tunnels, so that the items can be managed from the outside.

This mod is being rebuilt as all updates of Expose/Exposer/Refined Proxy used for similar purposes have been stopped.
Operation is not guaranteed and ports to other versions will not be considered.
