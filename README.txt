WARN: Always make a backup before use.
The author is not responsible for any damage caused by the use of this mod.

This mod is intended to expose items on the RefinedStorage network to external storage management systems
(Integrated Tunnels etc.), so that the items can be managed from the outside.

Created as a personal mod as all updates to Expose/Exposer/Refined Proxy, which were used for similar purposes, have been stopped.
Operation is not guaranteed and ports to other versions will not be considered.

Also, pointing external storage to this block may result in circular references and world corruption.
